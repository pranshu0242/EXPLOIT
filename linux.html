But its user interface and ease of use has been steadily improving over the last few years. Linux has today become user-friendly enough to replace Windows on desktops.</span>

                                    Programs cannot make changes to the system settings and configuration unless the user is logged in as the root (equivalent to the administrator user in Windows) user. Most users do not log in as the root; hence, they cannot do much damage to the system, except to their own files and programs, since the downloaded file/malware will have limited privileges. You can browse the Internet without worrying about your system getting infected. However, users can install ClamAV antivirus software in Linux to further secure their systems.</span>

Linux makes very efficient use of the system’s resources. Linux installation can be customised for users and for specific hardware requirements. The installation procedure is very flexible, and allows users to choose the modules they want to install. This allows them to install Linux even on old hardware, thus helping in optimal use of all the hardware resources.</span>

                                <span class="tag">--</span><span>The most important aspect of Linux is that its source code is available as it falls under the FOSS category (Free and Open Source Software). The developer community benefits from this as its members have the freedom to view and modify the source code, which is not the case with proprietary software, which they can only use. Several countries are developing their own versions of Linux. This will ultimately help these countries in developing their own OSs for specialised or strategic areas like defence, communications, etc, to begin with.

                                    Cyber warfare will play an important role in any war in the future. Usage of foreign and compromised computer operating systems and communication software can bring the country to its knees within a few days, both militarily and economically. Hence, using FOSS tools is critical for the security of any country. Several countries including China, Russia and Cuba are developing their own OSs based on Linux. C-DAC has developed BOSS (Bharat Operating System Solutions), India’s own PC operating system.</span>

There are numerous choices for wallpapers, desktop icons and panels. There are more than half-a-dozen desktop environments to choose from, like GNOME, KDE, etc. For any task, right from the GUI interface and file managers, to DVD burners and browsers, around four to six options are available for any particular software. The Linux versions of most popular browsers are available.The Linux philosophy is based on using several small programs, each of which does one task very well. But these programs can be combined to write really powerful programs and utilities. The Linux OS offers a command line interface with several shells to choose from. Systems administrators can enjoy the powerful command line interface and write shell scripts to automate routine maintenance and various other tasks.</span>
