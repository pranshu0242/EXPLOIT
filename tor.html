                                The Onion Router, from which the acronym TOR comes from, was primarily developed for the use by the US military, predominantly Navy, as to mask their IP addresses which could lead to theft of sensitive data while gathering information on missions. Once the military passed to in-house high anonymity VPN systems, TOR was released as an open source free software, that is completely legal to use and possible to download from the TOR website.

                            <span class="tag">--</span><span>The main part of the interface of TOR is the TOR Browser, previously known as TBB or TOR Browser Bundle, which consists of a modified Mozilla Firefox ESR browser, TOR Launcher, the TOR Button, NoScript, HTTPS EFE and the TOR proxy. This is the whole program that installs all the parts beneath the browser automatically. Once you send your request, TOR browser will encrypt it and send it through</span>

                            <span class="tag">--</span><span>The TOR project doesn’t use any dedicated server and all the traffic that is conducted goes through its users, now numbering well over 3 million online at any given time, with that number sometimes passing 4 million. This is a very ingenious system as it removes the main weak points of a proxy connection and relies only on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) connections to mask the IP addresses.

                                It is also good to point out that TOR doesn’t actually hide your IP address from the internet or negates the connection that you have with your ISP, but rather creates a flooding effect where people who are on any point in the connection can’t be certain about the origin of the IP address that they are getting the request.</span>

                            <span class="tag">--</span><span>This is the computer that has the information that you want to see and after it receives the request that originated from your computer sends it back through the last user that was online, again randomly jumping through TOR users, finally reaching you at your browser.

                                This way it is impossible to ping back all the IP addressed back to you, preventing some more tech-savvy companies from finding your address even through a proxy. In this way, TOR acts more like a VPN service that entirely shields the user from scanning software.</span>

                            <span class="tag">--</span><span>The TOR project, as well as all of its assisting software, could be best described as not illegal, as there is no legislation that explicitly forbids the use of this software or this type of software in the world. This may be because this is still a new technology from the perspective of any legislator, but even if we were to imagine why would TOR be banned there is nothing explicitly illegal in the software itself.

                                This being said, most governments, and especially those who have made a habit of restricting the communication between their citizens, have come up with some measures as to prevent people from using TOR.
                                
                                As the program only masks the identity of the user but not the fact that they are using the TOR browser, some servers and ISPs have blocked those using TOR from accessing any of the information they may be storing. This prevents anyone with a TOR browser to request any data through that specific ISP.</span>

                            <span class="tag">--</span><span>The whole TOR project has identified two weak points in the whole of their functions, primary being the network of users itself, as this makes the entrance to any attack quite obvious, and the other being the fact that TOR is an open source program, meaning that its source code is available to anyone wishing to see it.

                                There are several ways hackers have exploited these weaknesses in the past, with only some being patched completely and other only being mended for the time being. Most of these types of attack require considerable resources and are available only to larger corporations and organized groups of hackers.
                                
                                When attacking, the attacker can either focus on some node (the user who is neither a primary nor the final destination of the data) or a group of nodes as to prevent them from processing any other requests but the ones they themselves are sending. Once blocked, the user stars showing their own browsing data as the program can’t process any more request but the ones being directly targeted through that node.</span>

                            <span class="tag">--</span><span>Because of the constant attacks, and probably even more because of the paranoid mindset of some TOR users, there have been evermore advanced updates to the program, its stability and its safety.

                                This is why even after the US government declared that 80% of TOR users will be de-anonymized swiftly at the beginning of 2013 after someone hacked the computer of then Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. Even though, as most of us can imagine, the US government has a lot of resources at their disposal, no significant number of TOR users have been de-anonymized to this day.
                                
                                If used correctly, the possibility of detection while using TOR is very low, but there are two ways the authorities try to find out who are the people using it. First of all, there are a lot of TOR opponents running poisonous nods that are made to damage the network around them and catch those not using all the safeguards of TOR to decrypt their information.</span>
